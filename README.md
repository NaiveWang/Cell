# P
A processor-oriented programming language

## Introduction
Different from most of programming model such as object-oriented-programming model, P is come up with an idea which is processor-oriented, that is, treating a processor as an atomic element, and in some high-level parallel computing occasions, this programming model could perform a more effective productivity. P is still a fragile infant in the cradle of my envision, and the implementation is halfway done, some ideas are still under discussion.
P contains two parts: one is the simulating environment, which I would prefer "PVM(P Virtual Machine)"; the other is a tool-chain including compiler, assembler and debugger. Now the the "PVM and assembler have finished, with demo functionalities.
The high-level language, which describes a whole project, its grammar is still under developing, and for this reason there is still a long way to go.
